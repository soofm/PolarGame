# INTRODUCTION

# CARDS

The game includes the following types of cards:

* Equipment
* Bounties
* Events

# STARTING THE GAME

Each player starts with a deck of six cards:

* 4 Blasters
* 2 Spanners

# ON YOUR TURN

At the beginning of each turn, draw three cards. On each turn, take the following actions:

* Draw an event card
* Spend resources to capture bounties
* Use credits to purchase upgrades at the exchange

You will have to be resourceful to capture bounties. Some targets will be elusive - you will have to purchase intel to track them down. Other targets will try to escape when found - you will have to chase them through space. Other targets will fight back - you will have to use your weapons to overcome them.
